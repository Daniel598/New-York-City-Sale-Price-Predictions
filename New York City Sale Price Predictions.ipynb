        "In tandem with the surge of big data, machine learning (ML) is seeing an unprecedented growth in many fields. The increased processing-capacity of ML promotes the need for increased data collection to be able to take advantage of the ever-increasing complexity of ML algorithms (Polyzotis et al., 2018, p.). Furthermore, the capabilities of these expert systems are endless, and in many fields already outperform or perform on-par with experts (Roh et al., 2019; Simarjeet et al., 2020). The trove of information collected is often labeled as business intelligence, and then used to maximize profit, and minimize risk for stakeholders. Our hypothesis is that culminates in a somewhat skewed power-balance between consumers and businesses in terms of access to information. This report will therefore focus on equipping the average person with valuable insights in their purchase of property. \n",
        " \n",
        "A large part of the report will elaborate on the thought process in regards to the choice of data features to be included, and how it is processed. The reason being that if the process is viewed from an end-to-end perspective, the majority of the workload will be pre-processing of the data. Moreover, choosing correctly from the wide array of techniques is critical to achieve high accuracy, and preserve the integrity of the original data. To achieve this we will be looking at how different ML algorithms perform at predicting sale prices for different properties in New York city over a 12-month period. The time frame being from September 2016 to September 2017 using a dataset from Kaggle (City of New York, 2017). A test of three classification algorithms, namely k-nearest neighbour (k-NN), Multinomial Bayes (MNB), and a support vector machine (SVC) classifier will be conducted. In addition three regression algorithms will be tested, specifically linear regression (with and without L1/Lasso and L2/Ridge regularisation), as well as a random forest regressor. Moreover, the data-set will be tested on two neural networks, one classifier, and one regressive.\n"

        "The data selection for our report was derived largely from trial and error with a goal of the highest possible accuracy. To confirm that these findings were in fact the best predictors, a heatmap using Seaborn was created to illustrate the correlation between the target value and the respective features (Figure 1). Approximately half of the features in the dataset were dropped (10/22). Some features were not relevant such as ‘Address’ and the unnamed feature numbering each row in the data, others showed a correlation that approximated null. The choice of ‘Sale price’ as the target data point was chosen because it was deemed to potentially produce the most meaningful data, and be practically useful for the target group. It can help the buyer more precisely understand the fluctuating prices as a result of the data features. A final list was concluded upon consisting of:\n",
        "\n",
        ">'Sale price', 'Sale date', 'Borough', 'Gross square feet', 'Total units', 'Year built', 'Land square feet', 'Zip code', 'Tax class at time of sale', ‘Neighborhood’, 'Building class category'\n",
        "\n",
        "The heat map (Figure 1) shows that the correlation is quite weak between the selected target ‘Sale price’ and features. A consequence which arises as a result of the weak correlation is an increased complexity of the ML algorithms as it is necessary to include more variables. Furthermore, as the feature count increases so does the need for pre-processing which in many cases causes a reduction of usable entries in the dataset."

        "The median household income in New York was 61,937 USD in 2018, which meant that considering a building price of more than 1,000,000 USD was deemed unrealistic for the target group (Guzman, 2019, p. 2). Therefore, we proceeded to limit the scope of sale price to values between 10,000 USD and 1,000,000 USD to remove buildings sold at unrealistically low prices, as well as the unreasonably expensive outliers that skewed the data. There were 11,230 rows with a value below 100 USD, which was deemed to either be incorrect, or not a legitimate sale. This led to a total of 27,215 rows being dropped."

        "To further inspect the data, we created a second correlation heatmap to check if the preprocessing affected the correlation between ‘Sale price’ and the features. The heatmap revealed that the addition of ‘Sale month’ had no effect and the correlation between sale price and gross square feet is reduced after dropping the NaN values and the data above 1,000,000. Tests were conducted which found that the consequences of dropping these aforementioned values were that the classifiers perform worse. However, the regressors gain some performance when the values above 1,000,000 were removed. Therefore, some accuracy was sacrificed either way. It was decided to remove these values as it helps limit the scope and get a better picture of the housing market for the average consumer. The gain in the classifiers accuracy with the ‘Sale price’ above 1,000,000 included  might be due to how the percentiles were split."

        "To best evaluate the algorithms a few criteria and metrics will be used. For the classifiers accuracy is utilised to measure the success, and for the regressive methods R2 coefficient illustrates how close the data is to the fitted line. In addition, cross-validation will be applied to ensure the validity of the results and ensure that the train/test split is not enforcing a bias. Moreover, k-fold will be applied to the cross-validation to prevent negative scores.\n",

        "We made the decision to use the same features on all the algorithms, as it would make for a more meaningful comparison. However, some specific changes to the classifier and the regressive methods were made. To make sure that the data could be classified correctly by the classifiers it was decided to round the target data to percentiles, which was only done for the classifiers. We opted on using every fifth percentile which resulted in a total of 21 different values for the classification, including the first percentile. The trade off is that the predictions won’t be as accurate, but will instead get an estimate of price range. Which will be helpful to the average house buyer to ascertain if a house is priced reasonably or not. It was concluded that the fifth percentile was a good balance between different price representations and the total accuracy of the predictions we aimed to achieve. In addition, the data was scaled using the minMax scaler.\n"

        "The MNB algorithm reported a training set score of 0.09 and a test set accuracy of 0.10. MNB is based on a naive assumption which implies the conditional independence of causes. It also means that each feature contributes independently regardless of correlation which could be a factor that contributes to the low accuracy score (Bonaccorso, 2017). Moreover, MNB is commonly used for document classification using the bag of words model where it disregards all but multiplicity. In this use case some features such as ‘Square feet’ have many unique variables, making it hard for the algorithm to make meaningful predictions. It raises the question of the feasibility of MNB on the dataset as manipulating it further can cause the data to lose its original value. The other option is to create a new collection of features to be used only by MNB, yet this would make it unusable in terms of comparison with the other ML models. "

To be able to compare the classifier algorithms it was decided to use equivalent methods for the preprocessing of data. The kNN method was used to establish a baseline, but came with the issue of overfitting. The baseline persisted through the testing, as the classifier with the highest accuracy. It was hypothesised that SVC would surpass kNN in terms of accuracy, but as SVC is generally hard to inspect and ascertain the reason for its predictions, the cause remains unknown. Nonetheless, the low accuracy implies that classifiers are not the best models for the specific target value."

Therefore, a more appropriate way to tackle this challenge would be using regressive algorithms without splitting the target values into percentiles. For regression, different scalers were applied, to ensure the most appropriate method was used. We tested the minMax, Standard, Max Abs, Robust, Quantile transformer, and last Power transformer Scalers. In the end, the power transformer scaler was elected, which makes the data more Gaussian-like. Due to the number of outliers and data variation in the data set it was deemed a good fit.

        "The regressive NN performs better than all other regressors with the exception of random forest, but does so without overfitting. The variation of the cross-validation scores are substantial, and it is speculated that it is a result of the significant variance within the dataset itself. In turn causing different splits of the validation set to vary greatly. Moreover, it is difficult to establish the learning curve as the solver 'L-BFGS' does not track loss during training. "

        "Early on it was concluded that an increase in features does not necessarily result in better accuracy, and could in some cases worsen it. The reason being that an increase in features often leads to a substantial reduction in the dataset. Herein a missing value in just one of the cell’s rows would culminate in removing the row entirely. The challenge then becomes finding a balance so as to not reduce the number of entries so drastically that the algorithms have enough data to base their predictions. Moreover, as the data is captured over a one year period it raises concerns about variables shaped excessively by events that have occurred in the respective timeframe. If the duration of the data-collection would be longer the variations could over-time be evened out, as it is impossible to address it without having intimate knowledge of the housing-market in NYC. This also comes with the premise that a feasible target value which correlates sufficiently with the features is chosen. In other words it may be beneficial to have fewer values that have a high correlation, yet if the set of features becomes too small it can result in overfitting. Nevertheless, this also comes with the risk of choosing features that correlate excessively, making the predictions lose their value. To illustrate it is not meaningful for an algorithm to predict zip codes derived from addresses as this could easily be found elsewhere."

        "Some algorithms handle predicting the data better than others. Classifiers seem to struggle with either overfitting or very low accuracy. Regression algorithms (especially the neural network) seem to produce accuracies that are both higher and more appropriately fitted. In spite of that, none of the algorithms produce particularly high accuracies.The few features we have, might not have a strong enough correlation to our target. The leading one being that sale prices fluctuate too much and may be dependent on too many unknown features not included in the data. A lot of missing data can result in poor predictions, as it is possible that they are the deciding factors in 'Sale price'.\n",

        "We concluded that there are way too many unknown features influencing the price for any of our algorithms to get accurate predictions with the current data. However, the interesting thing here might not actually be accuracy. But rather how far the predictions are from the actual sales price, and the residual between the two. If we can get a rough estimate for a house's value that is close enough this could be useful for setting a price on a house. It also gives the buyer and seller a sense of security, knowing that the house was sold and bought at a reasonable price.\n",
